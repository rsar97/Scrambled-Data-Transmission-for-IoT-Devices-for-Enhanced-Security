# Scrambled-Data-Transmission-for-IoT-Devices-for-Enhanced-Security
Internet of things is developing at an extremely fast pace than ever in this decade, and it is a topic we cannot avoid coming across in our daily lives. But has anyone wondered about the security of your simple smart doorbell's privacy or of your smart bulb? In this modern era where millions of IoT datas are being connected to Internet and the sensor values being transmitted, information security of the sensor datas are a big concern. There is a lot of data breaches that has being reported in the last few years. To mitigate any data breaches or unauthorized access of IoT information, this paper we propose a solution to protect the data transmitted to and from the IoT device. In this paper TRNG designed using reversible gates generates the OTP which is sent to the client by the ESP. Based on the authentication status the original sensor data/scrambled sensor data is sent to the client. We scramble the data which is being transmitted from the IoT device to the controlling device to enable some privacy and get some control over the data, which is being passed over, rendering the data useless to the attacker who tries to steal the data. The main objective is to prevent brute force attack/dictionary attacks on interpreting the OTP. We compare the data that is being transferred both during the authorized and unauthorized phase.
